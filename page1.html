<div>I Hope You Enjoy Reading My Poems and Short Stories
</div><div><br></div><div>I love to write. All day long there are words bouncing around in my head that if I take the time to write them down, poems or short stories are formed.
</div><div>
</div><div>I have written some poems for children. Be sure to check out "Sleigh Ride",
</div><div>It was lots of fun writing it.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>Also I will be adding a couple about the creation, my favorite part of the Bible. The love poems and the sad poems are more so for the adults to read.
</div><div>
</div><div>Sometimes I tend to write too many sad ones, but everyone has moments of sadness in their lives.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>Be sure to check out the site often for new poems or stories..
</div><div>I have a section set up for poems and another one for shortstories.</div><div>
</div><div>I am hoping to publish a few of the short stories on Amazon.
<span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></div><div>I just published an adult fiction story, 'My Life Changed Forever,' on Amazon.
</div><div>My book has been released for purchase.
</div><div><br></div><div>I am also going to add a childrens short story, 'Raining.'
</div><div>This story has already been published once in an online children's magazine.
</div><div>
</div><div>It has been released to me again to publish. If interested, please check out books by, Barbara A Ross.
</div><div><br></div><div>Thank You for visiting my site.. I hope you enjoy reading my poems and short stories.I really enjoy writing them and sharing them with you.
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>If you would like to use one, please place a link back to my site so that others can read some of my other work.
</div><div>
</div><div>Also please remember to credit me for the poem. Not take them as your own.
</div><div>
</div><div>They are under a copywrite.
</div><div>
</div><div>Thank you

    <div class="container">
        <div class="media-container-row">
            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>It's is always nice to know a little about the person who is writing the poems, short stories or articles you are reading. So I am going to tell you a bit about me.
</p><p></p><div>I was born on January 1st, 1955. Yes, I am a New Years Baby. I hear that all the time. Not the first of the year but I think I came a close second.</div><div><br></div><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>My parents had tried very hard to get me to come a day or so earlier, but I guess I wanted to have a chance at being number one.
</div><div>I had a grandmother, Elizabeth J Miller, who was a gifted writer. I sometimes feel she is a part of me as this writing all comes so easy.
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>She also wrote many poems and short stories. If I ever get the link to her website my cousin set up in her honor, I will link it to this one.
</div><div>It's funny how close I feel to my grandmother. She died at a rather young age and I was only 3 years old. She had a very bad type of asthma.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Sometimes I feel as if someone is leading me as I write. Some poems, such as the creation were written without me even realizing the words 
</div><div>were flowing and I was writing them down. I was a senior in high school sitting in my home room class when that happened.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>As everyone does, I have grown older. I have 4 children, 2 girls and 2 boys. They are wonderful people and are also grown up now. </div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>Only one remains at home for a little while yet. My youngest finished college and is now starting the police academy in hopes of getting 
</div><div>a job with a police force after graduating.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>My three other children are working in their careers. My daughters have blessed me with 7 grandchildren at this time with the 8th due October 29th. 
</div><div>There are 5 girls and 2 boys right now. The newest will also be a boy. All grandchildren age between 2 and 7 years.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;I babysit the older 5, the two youngest are twins and go to a daycare. They do keep me busy, but I enjoy spending this special time with them all. 
</div><div>They also love my stories.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>I live in the United States, in Ohio. I am married and we just celebrated our 38th year of marriage. A great joy is my parents also just celebrated their 
</div><div>62nd year of marriage. They are turning 84 this year.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>I have my dog, Roscoe and a stray cat who really lives at our house named, Porter.
</div><div><br></div><div>I am a Christian. I believe Jesus died for me so that my sins will be forgiven and I can join him in heaven to serve him there some day.
</div><div>Not in a big hurry though.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>I also have two blogs I have written and may write a third that are my own. Then I write articles for 4 other blogs owned by another person. 
</div><div>I enjoy spending time on the internet and have many friends from all over the world.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>I do hope you enjoy the site. Someday I may add a way for your to communicate with me and express feelings about what you have read.
</div><div>Thanks for visiting my site and learning more about me.</div><div><br></div><div>
