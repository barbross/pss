<div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Old Man Kerr lived deep in the woods in a run down log cabin with his three beautiful daughters: Mary Beth, Jessica and Grace.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mary Beth, the oldest, never had time to do anything but sit around and brush her hair.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Jessica, the second daughter, was always in a hurry and let nothing get in her way.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Grace, the youngest daughter, was very kind and considerate of others. She was always willing to help someone in need.</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">One Saturday morning, Old Man Kerr went to Mary Beth, who was sitting at her dressing table brushing her long blond hair and said,
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"It is your turn to collect the honey from the bee hives."
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Not today," said Mary Beth. "Jason is coming over later. I must brush my hair until it's silky and smooth."</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"It is your turn and you must go," said her father. "There will be plenty of time for you to get ready for Jason when you get back."
</span></div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mary Beth slammed the brush down on her dressing table and stomped out of the room.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"You would not make Grace go if she had something else to do even if it was her turn."
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Out in the shed, Mary Beth gathered the buckets and netting to get the honey. As she walked </span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">down the narrow path towards the hives, an old woman approached her.</span></div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Good morning," said the old woman in a scratchy sounding voice. "Would you be so kind as to help me thread this needle so I can finish sewing this dress? 
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">I can not see very good these days."
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"I have far too much to do," said Mary Beth walking past the old woman.</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"It is a special dress for a special girl," said the old woman."It is for the wedding of a princess."
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Let her sew it herself," said Mary Beth. "I simply do not have time."
</span></div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"You are a foolish girl," the old woman screamed frightening Mary Beth as she backed away from the crazy old woman.</span></div><br><div> 
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Not looking where she was going, she backed right into the bee hives. In seconds angry bees were swarming all over Mary Beth and stinging her. 
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">She threw down her buckets and netting as she ran for home.
</span></div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">A little later that same day, Old Man Kerr went to his second daughter, Jessica.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Jessica," he said,"your sister Mary Beth has been badly stung by bees. She is nursing her stings and will not be able to collect the honey today."
</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Now you want me to do it?" said Jessica. "I have soccer practice. Why can not Grace do it?"
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"We need honey," said Old Man Kerr."Grace ia a bit young to go around a hive of angry bees."
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Fine," said Jessica kicking her soccer ball into her closet. "I will do it, but I must hurry."
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Make sure you put on the protective netting before you get close to the hives," said Old Man Kerr.</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Jessica hurried along the same path that Mary Beth had taken earlier. She found the buckets and the netting Mary Beth had dropped. 
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Remembering what her father had said, she put the netting on right away. "Good morning," said the old woman to Jessica in her scratchy voice.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Who are you?" asked Jessica jumping back away from the old woman. "Where did you come from?"
</span></div><br><div><br></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"I am an old woman in need of help," she said. "I must finish this dress for the wedding of a princess tomorrow and I can not thread this needle. 
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Could you please thread it for me?"
</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Get some glasses," said Jessica, pushing past the old woman. "I don't have time for any princess. Let me collect my honey and be on my way."
</span></div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"You selfish girl," the old woman said laughing. As Jessica approached the bee hives, a strong wind blew off her protective netting. 
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">The bees grew angry again at another unwanted visitor approaching them. They swarmed around Jessica and started stinging her. 
</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">She threw down her empty buckets and ran for home.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">The old lady laughed as she ran past her still standing in the path with the dress in her hands.</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Without honey to take to town to sell, the family would have no dinner that night. Old Man Kerr had no choice but to ask his youngest daughter, Grace.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Grace," said Old Man Kerr, "you are so young. I do not like sending you out there with the bees so angry, but your sisters are both now nursing their bee stings. 
</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">You are the only one left. I would go myself if it weren't for this bad leg."
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"That is alright Father," said Grace. "I would not want anything to happen to you. I will be so quiet that the bees will not even know I am there."</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Grace skipped along the same path her sisters had followed. She picked up the empty buckets and found the netting tangled in a bush nearby. 
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Then she saw an old woman sitting on a log.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">She walked up to the old woman who was trying to thread her needle.
</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"You are having such a hard time with that," said Grace, " let me help you."
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Thank you so very much," the old woman said</span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">with tears in her eyes. "I cannot hardly see what I am doing. My eyes are old and tired."
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"I can thread it for you," said Grace, "and there is not much more to sew on the dress. I will finish it for you."
</span></div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Grace sat down on the log next to the old lady and sewed the finishing touches on the dress.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"This is a beautiful dress," said Grace. "Who is it for?"</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Grace looked around. The old woman was gone. Grace took the dress and hung it over a nearby tree branch for the old woman to find when she returned. 
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">The she went to gather the honey.
</span></div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Next to the hives she found the purest white goose she had ever seen with feathers trimmed in gold.</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"My this is a mysterious day," said Grace. "Where did you ever come from? I must find your owner."
</span></div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Grace picked up the goose and carried it home along with the honey she had gathered.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mary Beth was sitting at her dressing table when Grace passed by her door with the goose.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Where is the honey?" said Mary Beth,"and what is that?"</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"The honey is on the kitchen table and this is a goose I found by the hives," said Grace.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Now we will have a delicious dinner," said Mary Beth. "I will have to invite Jason to stay for dinner. Start cleaning that goose right away."
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"I am taking this goose to town to find its' rightful owner," said Grace walking away.</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"You are going to do no such thing," said Mary Beth grabbing the goose.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Let go," shouted Grace.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"I cannot let go," said Mary Beth. "I am stuck!"
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Stop pulling so hard," said Grace.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"What are you two doing," asked Jessica.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Just put down your soccer ball and try to pull me off," said Mary Beth.
</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Jessica grabbed hold of Mary Beth's waist and pulled.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Pull harder," shouted Mary Beth and Grace together.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"I....I cannot," said Jessica. "Now I am stuck too."
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"What is it with you two," said Grace. "Let go. Now!"</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"What is all the commotion about," asked Old Man Kerr. "Well, Father," said Grace. "I found this goose and I want to take it to town when we 
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">take the honey to find it's owner. 
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Now Mary Beth and Jessica are both saying they are stuck."</span></div><br><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"We are," they shouted at the same time.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"This is quite funny," said Father chuckling out loud. "Hold the goose tight while I pull on Jessica."
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Father,it is not working," said Jessica. "I am still stuck."
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Now so am I," said Father. "What are we going to do?"</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"We are going to town to find the owner," said Grace. "He will know what to do."
</span></div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Grace started down the path to town to find the owner. Following along behind her was her two sisters and her father.</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">As they walked along, they met a man and his young son.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Look father," said the boy, "they are playing follow the leader. I am going to play with them."
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"No!" his father shouted but it was too late. The boy was already stuck to his dad.
</span></div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">The boy had grabbed onto Old Man Kerrs' back and was stuck. Grace not knowing the boy was stuck also continued onto to town.</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Come back with my son," the boys father shouted as he ran after them. When he caught up with them and tried to pull his son away, 
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">he also became stuck.</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">On went Grace down the path towards town with her sisters, her father, the young boy and the boys father all following along behind her.
</span></div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">As they approached the town, Grace saw it was elaborately decorated for the wedding of the prince which was to take place the very next day.</span></div><br><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Grace looked around expecting the people to be happy, but found they looked very sad.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Why are you all so sad?" she asked a baker outside his store. "Tomorrow is going to be such a wonderful celebration."</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Yes, tomorrow was to be a grand occasion," said the baker. "I have a cake all prepared.
</span></div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Now the prince is very sad. He has not found the princess he was searching for. She must be loving, honest and willing to put others 
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">happiness before her own." 
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"She would be a very special person then," said Grace. "That is sad and I hope he finds her soon."</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"What have you there?" asks the baker.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"I am trying to find the owner of this goose. Do you know who it belongs to?"
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"To the prince," said the baker with a smile on his face."I think the prince will be very happy to see you have found his golden goose."</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Grace started up the gold paved path to the palace. As she walked, more and more people joined in the line behind her with her sisters, her father, 
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">the young boy and his dad. 
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">They were all suddenly laughing and having a good time as they also became stuck to one another.
</span></div><br><div><br></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">The prince, hearing the laughter of the towns people, looked out his window. There he saw a line of people a mile long. He walked out to greet them.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Welcome," said the prince.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Grace bowed to the prince. "Are you the owner of this beautiful goose?" she asked the prince.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Yes," said the prince, "thank you for returning her to me."
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Release us," chanted the crowd that had joined Grace and the others as they walked through the town.</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">The prince took the goose from Grace. Once he did, Mary Beth, Jessica, Old Man Kerr, the young boy, his father and all the towns people were set free.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Now that my family and friends have been set free, I must return home," said Grace.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Thank you for setting them free."</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"You cannot go just yet," said the prince. "My mother, the queen, has something very special to give you."
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"I am not seeking a reward for returning the goose," said Grace to the queen.
</span></div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Tomorrow," said the queen, "is going to be the most magnificent wedding celebration this town has ever seen. I want you to be a part of it."</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"You are the old woman from the woods," said Grace."You left before I could return the dress to you."
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"The dress you finished is the dress you will be wearing tomorrow," said the queen.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Will you marry me?" asked the prince and the queen handed Grace the wedding dress.</span></div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"I am not a princess," said Grace.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Tomorrow you will be," said the prince. " You are loving, honest and put others happiness before your own. You are the one I have been searching for."
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">The prince turned to the crowd and said," behold, my new princess if she will have me."</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><div>
</div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">"I will be honored," said Grace, "to be your wife. "Tomorrow."</span></div><br><div>
