                Grace and The Golden Goose - Part 2</h1>
            <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-left mbr-light pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">"You are going to do no such thing," said Mary Beth grabbing the goose.
<div>"Let go," shouted Grace.
</div><div>"I cannot let go," said Mary Beth. "I am stuck!"
</div><div>
</div><div>"Stop pulling so hard," said Grace.
</div><div>"What are you two doing," asked Jessica.</div><br><div>
</div><div>"Just put down your soccer ball and try to pull me off," said Mary Beth.
</div><div>
</div><div>Jessica grabbed hold of Mary Beth's waist and pulled.
</div><div>"Pull harder," shouted Mary Beth and Grace together.
</div><div>"I....I cannot," said Jessica. "Now I am stuck too."
</div><div>"What is it with you two," said Grace. "Let go. Now!"</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>"What is all the commotion about," asked Old Man Kerr. "Well, Father," said Grace. "I found this goose and I want to take it to town when we take the honey to find it's owner. Now Mary Beth and Jessica are both saying they are stuck."
</div><div>"We are," they shouted at the same time.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>"This is quite funny," said Father chuckling out loud. "Hold the goose tight while I pull on Jessica."
</div><div>"Father,it is not working," said Jessica. "I am still stuck."
</div><div>"Now so am I," said Father. "What are we going to do?"</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>"We are going to town to find the owner," said Grace. "He will know what to do."
</div><div>Grace started down the path to town to find the owner. Following along behind her was her two sisters and her father.
</div><div>
</div><div>As they walked along, they met a man and his young son.
</div><div>"Look father," said the boy, "they are playing follow the leader. I am going to play with them."</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>"No!" his father shouted but it was too late. The boy was already stuck to his dad.
</div><div>The boy had grabbed onto Old Man Kerrs' back and was stuck. Grace not knowing the boy was stuck also continued onto to town.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>"Come back with my son," the boys father shouted as he ran after them. When he caught up with them and tried to pull his son away, he also became stuck.
</div><div>
</div><div>On went Grace down the path towards town with her sisters, her father, the young boy and the boys father all following along behind her.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>As they approached the town, Grace saw it was elaborately decorated for the wedding of the prince which was to take place the very next day.
</div><div>
</div><div>Grace looked around expecting the people to be happy, but found they looked very sad.
</div><div>"Why are you all so sad?" she asked a baker outside his store. "Tomorrow is going to be such a wonderful celebration."</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>"Yes, tomorrow was to be a grand occasion," said the baker. "I have a cake all prepared. Now the prince is very sad. He has not found the princess he was searching for. She must be loving, honest and willing to put others happiness before her own."
</div><div>
</div><div>"She would be a very special person then," said Grace. "That is sad and I hope he finds her soon."</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>"What have you there?" asks the baker.
</div><div>"I am trying to find the owner of this goose. Do you know who it belongs to?"
</div><div>"To the prince," said the baker with a smile on his face."I think the prince will be very happy to see you have found his golden goose."</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Grace started up the gold paved path to the palace. As she walked, more and more people joined in the line behind her with her sisters, her father, the young boy and his dad. They were all suddenly laughing and having a good time as they also became stuck to one another.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>The prince, hearing the laughter of the towns people, looked out his window. There he saw a line of people a mile long. He walked out to greet them.
</div><div>"Welcome," said the prince.
</div><div>
</div><div>Grace bowed to the prince. "Are you the owner of this beautiful goose?" she asked the prince.
</div><div>"Yes," said the prince, "thank you for returning her to me."</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>"Release us," chanted the crowd that had joined Grace and the others as they walked through the town.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>The prince took the goose from Grace. Once he did, Mary Beth, Jessica, Old Man Kerr, the young boy, his father and all the towns people were set free.
</div><div>
</div><div>"Now that my family and friends have been set free, I must return home," said Grace.</div><br><div>
</div><div>"Thank you for setting them free."
</div><div>"You cannot go just yet," said the prince. "My mother, the queen, has something very special to give you."</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>"I am not seeking a reward for returning the goose," said Grace to the queen.
</div><div>"Tomorrow," said the queen, "is going to be the most magnificent wedding celebration this town has ever seen. I want you to be a part of it."
</div><div>
</div><div>"You are the old woman from the woods," said Grace."You left before I could return the dress to you."
</div><div>"The dress you finished is the dress you will be wearing tomorrow," said the queen.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>"Will you marry me?" asked the prince and the queen handed Grace the wedding dress.
</div><div>"I am not a princess," said Grace.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>"Tomorrow you will be," said the prince. " You are loving, honest and put others happiness before your own. You are the one I have been searching for."
</div><div>The prince turned to the crowd and said," behold, my new princess if she will have me."</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>"I will be honored," said Grace, "to be your wife. "Tomorrow."</div><br><div><br></div></h3>
