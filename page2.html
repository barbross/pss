                <div><br></div><div><em>About the Author</em></div><br><div><em><br></em></div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>It's is always nice to know a little about the person who is writing the poems, short stories or articles you are reading. So I am going to tell you a bit about me.</div><br><div>
</div><div>I was born on January 1st, 1955. Yes, I am a New Years Baby. I hear that all the time. Not the first of the year but I think I came a close second.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>My parents had tried very hard to get me to come a day or so earlier, but I guess I wanted to have a chance at being number one.
</div><div>I had a grandmother, Elizabeth J Miller, who was a gifted writer. I sometimes feel she is a part of me as this writing all comes so easy.
</div><div>
</div><div>She also wrote many poems and short stories. If I ever get the link to her website my cousin set up in her honor, I will link it to this one.</div><br><div>
</div><div>It's funny how close I feel to my grandmother. She died at a rather young age and I was only 3 years old. She had a very bad type of asthma.
</div><div>
</div><div>Sometimes I feel as if someone is leading me as I write. Some poems, such as the creation were written without me even realizing the words
</div><div>were flowing and I was writing them down. I was a senior in high school sitting in my home room class when that happened.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>As everyone does, I have grown older. I have 4 children, 2 girls and 2 boys. They are wonderful people and are also grown up now.
</div><div>Only one remains at home for a little while yet. My youngest finished college and is now starting the police academy in hopes of getting
</div><div>a job with a police force after graduating.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>My three other children are working in their careers. My daughters have blessed me with 7 grandchildren at this time with the 8th due October 29th.
</div><div>There are 5 girls and 2 boys right now. The newest will also be a boy. All grandchildren age between 2 and 7 years.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>I babysit the older 5, the two youngest are twins and go to a daycare. They do keep me busy, but I enjoy spending this special time with them all.
</div><div>They also love my stories.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>I live in the United States, in Ohio. I am married and we just celebrated our 38th year of marriage. A great joy is my parents also just celebrated their
</div><div>62nd year of marriage. They are turning 84 this year.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>I have my dog, Roscoe and a stray cat who really lives at our house named, Porter.
</div><div>I am a Christian. I believe Jesus died for me so that my sins will be forgiven and I can join him in heaven to serve him there some day.
</div><div>Not in a big hurry though.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>I also have two blogs I have written and may write a third that are my own. Then I write articles for 4 other blogs owned by another person.
</div><div>I enjoy spending time on the internet and have many friends from all over the world.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>I do hope you enjoy the site. Someday I may add a way for your to communicate with me and express feelings about what you have read.
</div><div>Thanks for visiting my site and learning more about me.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
